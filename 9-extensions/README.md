# Chapter 9. Extensions

The simulation results of Sections 9.1 and 9.2 can be obtained and plotted by running the following files:
- ``compute.sh``: Compute the numerical results of Section 9.1. Compile the C source file ``scheduling-and-balancing-exact.c`` and calls the obtained executable.
- ``plot.ipynb``: Plot the results in a Jupyter Notebook. This file also computes the numerical results of Section 9.2.

All obtained data files are stored in the folder ``data/``.
