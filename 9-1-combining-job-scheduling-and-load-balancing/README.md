# Section 9.1. Combining job scheduling and load balancing 

The simulation results of Section 9.1 can be obtained and plotted by running the following files:
- ``compute.sh``: Compute the exact results predicted by the model of Subsection 9.1.2. Compile the C source file ``exact.c`` and calls the obtained executable. The results are stored in the folder ``data/``.
- ``plot.ipynb``: Plot the results in a Jupyter Notebook.
