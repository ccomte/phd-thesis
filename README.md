[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/201924451.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/201924451)

Numerical results presented in the Ph.D. thesis <em>Resource Management in Computer Clusters: Algorithm Design and Performance Analysis</em> defended by CÃ©line Comte at Institut Polytechnique de Paris on September 24, 2019.

The [video](https://youtu.be/1cBrZ5TF54Q) and [slides](https://www.win.tue.nl/~ccomte/talks/19-phd.pdf) of the Ph.D. defense give an overview of the thesis motivations and main contributions. For a deeper understanding, you can also read the [manuscript](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02413496).

Each folder of the repository corresponds to a chapter or section of the manuscript. The notations are consistent and are therefore not recalled.
