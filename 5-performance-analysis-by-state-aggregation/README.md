# Chapter 5. Performance analysis by state aggregation

The simulation results can be obtained and plotted by running the following two files:
- ``compute.sh``: Compute the results (takes a few minutes on a commodity computer).
This script calls the C source file ``bounds.c``, which implements the formulas derived in Section 5.4.
- ``plot.ipynb``: Plot the results in a Jupyter Notebook.
